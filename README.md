# Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to construct an email client with a number of various functionalities. We were placed in groups of 4 and given this objective. Our project was to be graded in four different sprints over the course of the semester, each with their own requirements of what was to be completed. All project deliverables for the sprints were stored in the GitHub repository.

# Project Objective and Features
At the beginning of the project, the group was given four primary requirements. They were as follows:

- A user should be able to login into his account to access his emails.

- A user should be able to compose, edit and send an email to other users.

- A user should be able to search and forward emails to other users.

- A user should be able to send attachments (image, files etc.) along with an email.

We were given an open-ended choice of what programming language and framework to achieve these objectives. The primary feature that the group focused on was sending email. The full description of our email client can be viewed under "User Stories"
