# Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to construct an email client with a number of various functionalities. We were placed in groups of 4 and given this objective. Our project was to be graded in four different sprints over the course of the semester, each with their own requirements of what was to be completed. All project deliverables for the sprints were stored in the GitHub repository.
